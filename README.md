# Premier-League-Prediction

## Introduction

The Premier League is considered one of the most competitive and exciting football leagues in the world, with billions of fans tuning in to watch the matches every year. As a fan of the Premier League, I created a machine learning model to predict the outcomes of matches in the league. The league is known for its competitiveness and unpredictability, making it an exciting league to follow. This analysis and machine learning model should be useful in gaining insights on match predictions in the Premier League.

## Data
The data used in this project was collected from the [Football Data](https://www.football-data.co.uk/) website, which provides historical match data for various football leagues. The dataset includes information on match results, team statistics, and betting odds.

## Methodology 
I used various machine learning technique, including Logistic Regression and Decicision Tree Classifier to build a model that predicts the outcome of Premier League matches. I also performed feature engineering and feature selection to improve the model's performance.

## Result 
The final model achieved an accuracy of 70% on the test set, which is promising for its application in football prediction.

## Conclusion
My model try to predict whether the host team will win or not in a football match in the England Football Division. The model achieved a high level of accuracy and can be further improved with more quality data and advanced techniques.

## Requirements
The code for this project was written in Python 3.8 and requires the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib

## Usage 
To run the code for this project, clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook file.
